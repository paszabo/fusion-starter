React Slingshot is a comprehensive starter kit for rapid application development using React. It offers a rich development experience including:

The starter kit includes a working example app that puts all of the above to use.

## Get Started
 1. **Initial Machine Setup**  
First time running the starter kit? Then complete the [Initial Machine Setup](https://github.com/coryhouse/vin-javascript-starter-kit#initial-machine-setup).
 2. **Clone the project**  
Open the command line of your choice and change to the directory where you'd like to start your project. Then clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/coryhouse/vin-react-starter-kit.git your-project-name`.  
 3. **Change directory**  
`cd your-project-name`. - Change directories into your project's root directory (the project name you chose in step 2):
 4. **Install Node packages**   
`npm install`
 5. **Run the example app**  
`npm start`
This will run the automated build process, start up a webserver, and open the application in your default browser. When doing development with this kit, you'll want to keep the command line open at all times so that your code is rebuilt and tests run automatically every time you hit save. Note: The -s flag is optional. It enables silent mode which suppresses unnecessary messages during the build.
 6. **Review the example app.** This starter kit includes a working example app that calculates fuel savings. Note how all source code is placed under /src. Tests are placed alongside the file under test. The final built app is placed under /dist. These are the files you run in production.
 7. **Delete the example app files.** Once you're comfortable with how the example app works, you can delete those files and begin creating your own app: `npm run remove-demo`.
 8. **Plop these files inside your .NET solution.** - However, important note: **DO NOT** add node_modules to your solution or source control. Just like Nuget, these files shouldn't be checked in. 
 9. **[Enable CORS on the APIs](https://github.com/coryhouse/vin-react-starter-kit#how-do-i-call-our-existing-web-apis) you need to call** 

##Initial Machine Setup
 1. **Install [the newest version of Node.js](https://nodejs.org)**
 2. **Install the newest version of [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**.  The recommended defaults are fine.
 3. **Install [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**. Browser-sync (and various other Node modules) rely on node-gyp, which requires Python on Windows.  
 4. **Install C++ Compiler**. Open Visual Studio and go to File -> New -> Project -> Visual C++ -> Install Visual C++ Tools for Windows Desktop. The C++ compiler is used to compile browser-sync (and perhaps other Node modules).
 5. **Install [React developer tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) and [Redux Dev Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en)** in Chrome. (Optional, but helpful)
 6. **Configure your Editor for React**. [Install the appropriate plugin](https://github.com/facebook/react/wiki/Complementary-Tools#jsx-integrations) and [configure your editor](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/blob/master/docs/how-to-configure-text-editors.md).
 7. **Add two lines to your [Windows hosts file](https://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/modify-your-hosts-file)** for motosnap.com: 
```
127.0.0.1 motosnap.com
127.0.0.1 www.motosnap.com
```
The api configuration example (in /src/api/api.js) assumes that you're running VinConnect and its APIs locally at motosnap.com, so these host entries make sure cross origin calls like this succeed: `motosnap.com/CarDashboard/API/CRMServiceBase/v1/customers/attachments/list?customerId=212746634`
